Now that we have our comprehensive dashboard design, let's implement the automated notification system to ensure you and Alyson never miss critical deadlines.

### 1. Daily Deadline Alert (7-Day Window)

1. In Airtable, go to "Automations" → "Create a custom automation"
    
2. Name it "Daily Deadline Alert"
    
3. **Trigger**: Schedule → Daily at 7:00 AM
    
4. **Find Records**: Deadlines table where:
    
    - Deadline Date is between Today and Today + 7 days
        
    - Status is not Complete
        
5. **Action**: Send email
    
    - To: Your email, Alyson's email
        
    - Subject: "Litigation Alert: Upcoming Deadlines (7-Day Window)"
        
    - Body:
        
    
    ```
    Good morning,
    
    Here are the upcoming litigation deadlines in the next 7 days:
    
    {% for record in records %}
    • DUE {{ record.fields['Deadline Date'] | date: '%A, %B %d, %Y' }} ({{ record.fields['Deadline Age'] }})
      {{ record.fields['Deadline Type'] }} - {{ record.fields['Case'].fields['Case Name'] }}
      Current Phase: {{ record.fields['Case'].fields['Phase'] }}
    {% endfor %}
    
    View full details on the Litigation Dashboard.
    ```
    

### 2. Critical 24-Hour Warning

1. Create another automation named "Critical Deadline Warning"
    
2. **Trigger**: Schedule → Daily at 8:00 AM
    
3. **Find Records**: Deadlines table where:
    
    - Deadline Date is Tomorrow
        
    - Status is not Complete
        
4. **Action**: Send email
    
    - Subject: "⚠️ URGENT: Litigation Deadlines Due TOMORROW"
        
    - Add high importance flag
        
    - More prominent formatting in email body
        

### 3. Weekly Planning Report

1. Create automation named "Weekly Litigation Overview"
    
2. **Trigger**: Schedule → Weekly on Monday at 9:00 AM
    
3. **Find Records**: Cases table where Status is Active
    
4. **Action**: Send email with:
    
    - Weekly summary of all cases by phase
        
    - Deadlines for the upcoming 30 days
        
    - Any red health cases highlighted
        

### 4. Past Due Notifications

1. Create automation named "Past Due Alert"
    
2. **Trigger**: Schedule → Daily at 9:00 AM
    
3. **Find Records**: Deadlines table where:
    
    - Deadline Date is before Today
        
    - Status is not Complete
        
4. **Action**: Send email with escalation notice
    

### 5. Case Update Notifications

1. Create automation named "Case Status Change Alert"
    
2. **Trigger**: When record matches conditions → Case Health changes to RED
    
3. **Action**: Send immediate notification
    

### Additional Implementation Notes:

1. Stagger notification times to avoid email overload
    
2. Use consistent formatting and color coding across all notifications
    
3. Include direct links to the dashboard views in each email
    
4. Set up optional SMS notifications for critical deadlines using Airtable's Twilio integration
    

These automations will work alongside your dashboard to create a comprehensive awareness system - the dashboard provides the visual overview while the notifications ensure nothing falls through the cracks by proactively alerting you to upcoming deadlines and issues.
